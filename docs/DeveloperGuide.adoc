== Introduction

=== Audiences

All university students. +
People who have the need for storing and managing contact information efficiently are suggested to use *`Weaver`*.

=== Purposes

. *`Weaver`* aims at providing efficient solution for university students to store and manage contact information.
. It devotes to improve the experience when users try to add person , delete person , edit person , remark person ect.
. Targeted at university students, *`Weaver`* is bringing shortcut for students to note meetings, calendars and course information.

*`Weaver`* is a command line based software for storing and managing contact information. It satisfies almost all functions might be needed by university students on storing and managing contact information.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `LoginPage` and a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` and `LoginPage`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Search Command

** The search command simply makes the find command more powerful as it looks for people with same name and date of birth. +
** Implementation is similar to the find command. +
** The command takes in two arguments, namely the name of the person and the date of birth. +
** Exceptions are thrown if invalid commands are entered. +

Below is a code snippet which shows how the search command parses the arguements. +

---
    @Override
    public boolean test (ReadOnlyPerson person) {

        if (keywords.size() <= 1) {
            logger.warning("The number of arguements entered do not match the command format");
            return false;
        }

        return StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keywords.get(0))
               && StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getDateOfBirth().date, keywords.get(1));
    }
---
// tag::remark[]


=== Remark mechanism

The remark mechanism remarks contacts with their module information.
The command takes two parameters, Index and ModuleInfo. TargetIndex specifies the person you want to remark to. And the module information specifies the person's module information.
If the index is invalid or the module information is not in the correct format, exceptions will be thrown. +
Format - photo [INDEX] [MODULEINFO]
e.g. remark 1 CS2103/LEC/1

[NOTE]
The correct format for module information is: +
MODULETITLE/MODULETYPE/MODULENUM
// end::remark[]

// tag::loginlogout[]
=== Login / Logout mechanism

The `login / logout` mechanism is a page which requires user to key in his username and password before he can use the addressbook. And once he is logged in, there will be a automatically generated file named as `username + addressbook.xml` storing the information about his own addressbook.

[NOTE]
It uses files which stores the information of legal username and password pair to check whether the username and password key in by users are valid.

image::login.png[width="800"]

With the extra layer, the UiManager is calling login page before it calls the MainWindow:
[source,java]
----

loginPage = new LoginPage(primaryStage, config, storage, prefs, logic, accPrefs);
loginPage.show();


----

The check mechanism is implemented in this way:
[source,java]
----
private boolean checkValid(String username, String password) {
        return accPrefs.getHm().get(username).equals(password);
}
----
[NOTE]
If user key in wrong user name or password, he will stuck at login page until he manages to get in.


Read the account information from file and save them into a hashmap.
[source,java]
----
public AccountsStorage setAccountMsg() throws DataConversionException, IOException {
        String accountMsg = this.readAccountsPrefs(this.accountsPath).toString();
        this.hm = makeMap(accountMsg);
        return this;
}

----

Logout is implemented using JavaFX.
[source,java]
----
@FXML
private void handleLogoutEvent() {
    logger.info("Trying to logout");
    this.hide();
    this.releaseResources();
    LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(primaryStage, config, storage, prefs, logic, accPrefs);
    loginPage.show();
}

----

image::logout.png[width="200"]

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `login / logout` feature +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `login` is compulsory. User must login before he can use the addressbook  +
**Pros:** Easier to implement. Not changing the structure of code. +
**Cons:** Previous test cases need to be rewrote to get use to this new page. +
**Alternative 2:** `login` is  optional. User can still use this addressbook without login. +
**Pros:** Previous test cases can still be used. +
**Cons:** Need to invoke `login page` from command level, which is very hard to implement. It changes a considerable
part of structure of the whole code.

---

**Aspect:** User experiences  +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `login` is compulsory. User must login before he can use the addressbook +
**Pros:** Level of security is increased. Each user has a separate file to store addressbook. This software now support
multiple users. +
**Cons:** User needs an account to use this addressbook. Operation become one layer more complex. +
**Alternative 2:** `login` is  optional. User can still use this addressbook without login.  +
**Pros:** Multiple choices for users. More flexible. +
**Cons:** The default page becomes public, anyone can read and modify it. +
// end::loginlogout[]

---

// tag::register[]
=== Register mechanism

The register feature enables users to put new valid accounts inside the accounts.json file. The file operations are similar to the one used in Login/Logout feature.

[NOTE]
It puts account information in the accounts.json file. Users must key in the same password twice for confirm.

image::Register.png[width="800"]

The check mechanism requires the username to be unique from all different ones:
[source,java]
----
private boolean checkValid() {
    if (accPrefs.getHm().get(username.getText()) != null) {
        logger.info("Register faild");
        return false;
    } else {
        logger.info("Register successful");
        return password.getText().equals(password1.getText());
    }
}

----

[NOTE]
If user key in wrong password, he will be stuck at login page until he manages to get in.

Register is implemented using JavaFX.
[source,java]
----
@FXML
private void handleRegisterEvent() {
    try {
        logger.info("Trying to register");
        if (checkValid()) {
            accPrefs.getHm().put(username.getText(), password.getText());
            accPrefs.saveAccountsPrefs(accPrefs, accPrefs.getUserPrefsFilePath());
            loginPage = new LoginPage(primaryStage, config, storage, prefs, logic, accPrefs);
            this.hide();
            loginPage.show();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        logger.info("Invalid input");
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
A user can go back using the back button.
// end::register[]


// tag::customizetagcolor[]
=== Customize tag color mechanism
Tag color can be changed by giving a `ChangeTagColorCommand`.
[NOTE]
User can change one or more than one tag to a different color in one command.

The diagram below shows the hierarchy of ChangeTagColorCommand.

image::ChangeTagColorCommandClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

We use a new class `TagColor` to represent a color of a tag. For every `Tag` object, it has a new field `tagColor` of `TagColor` class which stores its associate tag color.

[NOTE]
When the tag color of a tag has not specified by the user yet, it is in default color orange. +
Tags with the same tag name are of the same color.

The diagram below shows the hierarchy of TagColor class.

image::TagColorClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

After every `ChangeTagColorCommand`, the tag and tag color pair will be stored in the storage file.
An `ChangeTagColorEvent` is raised so that the tag color in the UI is also updated accordingly. +
The structure in .xml storage file is like the following:
[source,css]
----
<persons>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <phone>98765432</phone>
    <email>johnd@example.com</email>
    <tagged>
        <name>friends</name>
        <color>orange</color>
    </tagged>
</persons>
<tags>
    <name>friends</name>
    <color>orange</color>
</tags>
----
The following code shows the execution of `ChangeTagColorCommand`
[source,java]
----
protected CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // Store all non existing tags
        Set<Tag> nonExistingTagList = new HashSet<>();

        // Check whether tags in the tagList are not existing tags
        for (Tag tag: tagList) {
            if (!isExistingTagName(tag)) {
                nonExistingTagList.add(tag);
            }
        }

        // There are tags that are not existing tags
        if (nonExistingTagList.size() != 0) {
            throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_NOT_EXISTING_TAGS, nonExistingTagList));
        }

        try {
            model.updateTagColorPair(tagList, color);
        } catch (IllegalValueException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILED);
        }

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeTagColorEvent(color.tagColorName));

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CHANGE_TAG_COLOR_SUCCESS, tagList, color.tagColorName));
    }
----
The sequence diagram below shows how the `ChangeTagColorCommand` works.

image::ChangeTagColorSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** How to associate each tag with a tag color? +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new class `TagColor` and add a new field to `Tag` class. +
**Pros:** The associate tag color is easy to get from a given tag. It is also very intuitive for each tag to have its tag color. +
**Cons:** It is complicated to implement. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a static hash map of all tag names(String) and their associate tag color(String) inside `Tag` class. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** All the methods associated with tag color will be stored inside `Tag` class, violates the single responsibility principle of classes.

---

**Aspect:** Colors supported of `TagColor` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Developers specify a list of available colors for users. +
**Pros:** It is easy to check whether the tag color name user typed in is valid. +
**Cons:** The choices of color is limited. +
**Alternative 2:** User can type in Hex Color Code as the color for tags. +
**Pros:** User may not know what is Hex Color Code. +
**Cons:** The colors available are various.
// end::customizetagcolor[]


// tag::customizeFontSize[]
=== Customize font size mechanism
The font size of the application can be changed via `ChangeFontSizeCommand` or by pressing the '+' or '-' button on the right top corner.

A new class FontSize is used to represent a font size.

The following diagram shows the hierarchy of FontSize class

image::FontSizeClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
Only five font sizes are supported: XS, S, M, L, XL

User can change the font size by giving the name of the exact font size which they want the app to be changed to. E.g. `fs xl`. Or they can
type in "+" or "-" symbol to increase or decrease the current font size. E.g. `fs +` +

Pressing the "+" button equals to giving `fs +` command and similarly for "-" button. +

If the current font size is the largest one and the user still gives `fs +` command or presses the "+" button to increase font sizes, a warning
will be shown on the display box saying "The current font size is the largest one." Similarly for decreasing the font size.

When a `ChangeFontSizeCommand` is made, a `ChangeFontSizeEvent` is raised. This event will be received by UI components such as
PersonCard. So that the font size in UI components will be updated accordingly. The following code shows how the event is handled
in the PersonCard.java.

[source,java]
----
@Subscribe
private void handleChangeFontSizeEvent(ChangeFontSizeEvent event) {
    String newFontSize = event.getFontSize();
    initTags(person, newFontSize);
    setFontSize(newFontSize);
    setSizeForAllImagesAccordingToFontSize(newFontSize);
    setSizeForPhotosAccordingToFontSize(newFontSize);
}
----

Noted that not only the font size is changed, the size of images and icons also are enlarged or reduced according to the
new font size. +

When the user exits the app, the current font size will be stored in the preferences.json in the following format.

[source,json]
----
{
  "guiSettings" : {
    "windowWidth" : 781.0,
    "windowHeight" : 600.0,
    "windowCoordinates" : {
      "x" : 426,
      "y" : 111
    },
    "fontSize" : "m",
    "theme" : "bright"
  },
  "addressBookFilePath" : "data/addressbook.xml",
  "addressBookName" : "MyAddressBook"
}
----
==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** How to represent a font size? +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new class `FontSize`. +
**Pros:** The methods associated with font size can be encapsulated inside one class. +
**Cons:** It increases coupling as a lot of UI components need to call the method of `FontSize` class. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a new field of `String` type in `GuiSetting` class. +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** The methods associated with font size will appear repeatedly in many UI component classes.

// tag::deletepersontag[]
=== Deleting a person's tag mechanism

The Deleting a person's tag mechanism consists of `DeleteTagCommand` and `DeleteTagCommandParser` classes.
The `DeleteTagCommandParser` resides inside `LogicManager`. `DeleteTagCommandParser` only deals with `Parser`. It is created from `AddressBookParser`. The following diagram shows the flow for parser:

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

`XYZCommand Parser` inherits from the `Parser` interface and is created by the AddressBook Parser as the `DeleteTagCommandParser`.
[NOTE]
The tags are parsed under `parseTagsForDelete`, while the person index is parsed under `parse` before execution. The tags are identified by the prefix `t/` to be parsed for deletion, and it must be fully matched.

The `DeleteTagCommand` resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of that modifies the state of Weaver. Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`DeleteTagCommand` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

`UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteTagCommand`.

Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command.

Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----
With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteTagCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Inside the `DeleteTagCommand` class, a `DeleteTagDescriptor` identifying the tags to be deleted will be created from `DeleteTagCommandParser`, which will create and update a new `createTagDeletedPerson` accordingly. This will overwrite the existing `ReadOnlyPerson` Person's Tags while retaining the rest of its attributes as seen from the Model diagram below.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the `Model` diagram, the `Person` retains the attributes that inherit it except for its own `UniqueTagList`, which is modified only for that particular `Person`.

Suppose that the user has just launched the application.

The user executes a new `DeleteTagCommand`, `deletetag 5 t/friends`, to delete the tag `friends` of the 5th person in the address book. The tags and the index are parsed into `DeleteTagCommandParser` before the `deletetag` command executes.

As the user continues to use the program, he might decide to delete more than one tags. For example, the user may execute `deletetag 2 t/colleagues t/friends` to delete multiple tags.

[NOTE]
If the tags are not fully matched, it will throw an `Exception`.

The user now decides that deleting the tags was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

Using the `Undo/Redo` stack, we will restore the address book to the state before the `delete/t` command is executed.

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteTagCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** To access the `Person` and overwrite a new `Person` to it. +
**Pros:** It will not lose the same tags for other `Person` it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Tags` like `UniqueTagsList` do not have to be deleted. +
**Cons:** It will be hard for new developers to understand the `UniqueTagsList`. +
**Alternative 2:** To delete the `Tag` in the `UniqueTagsList` +
**Pros:** It does not involve `Person` model, easier for new developers to understand with less coupling. +
**Cons:** It will defeat the purpose of deleting a tag solely of the specific `Person`. Might take more effort to organise tags for users.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of `DeleteTagCommandParser` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** To be able to utilise `Index` and tag prefix `t/`. +
**Pros:** It will be able to delete multiple tags. It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** It will pose difficulties for the user. User will have to type additional prefixes to delete. +
**Alternative 2:** To not utilise prefix `t/`. +
**Pros:** It will be easier and faster to delete with no prefix identifier. +
**Cons:** It will be difficult to implement, as it is harder to tokenize the arguments to differentiate between index and tag.

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of deleting only a person's tags +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):**
To continue to contain the tag in `UniqueTagsList` even if there are no tags for any `Person`. +
**Pros:** It will be easy to implement. +
**Cons:** It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** To clean up the `UniqueTagsList` after deleting its last tag. +
**Pros:** It will use less memory (e.g. for `UniqueTagsList`, will not contain tags that are not present in any `Person`). +
**Cons:** It must be ensured that the implementation for discovering the last tags of the list
 is correct. It may be harder to implement for new developers.

// end::deletepersontag[]

// tag::addphoto[]
=== Adding a photo to a contact in your personalised Weaver.

** The add Photo command adds a display picture to a particular contact.
** The command takes in two parameters, TargetIndex that is the index of the person to add a photo and the image filepath. +
** The command can also be used to delete an existing picture of a person.If the person has no display picture and the user attempts to delete a picture, an exception
will be thrown. +
** The photo Command is inherited from the `UndoableCommand` class. The command supports the Undo/Redo mechanism in Weaver. +
** The photo command is done with the help of ImageView property in JAVAFX, hence it is an attempt to enhance the UI. +



*PRE-REQUISITE* +
There is a pre-requisite for the command to work. The image that is going to be added to the contact must already be
present on the user's local PC. If it is not so, Weaver is going to throw an exception and prompt the user to add a valid File path.


*Working Flow* +

** The `PhotoCommandParser` Class parses the arguments entered in the photo command.The class then throws an Exception with the
appropriate message depending on whether the File name is present in the path specified by the user or if the number of arguments entered
is not equal to two. +

** The `PhotoCommand` class takes care of Invalid conditions like incorrect index. +

** It then creates a new instance of the `FileImage` class. `FileImage` is an attribute that every person must have.
A new `Person` is created with the updated `FileImage` and the existing model is updated.

*Sequence Diagram*

image::PhotoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2

The Sequence diagram (Figure 3.2) above shows the working flow of the Photo command feature. +

** The `ModelManager` class implements the `addPhotoToPerson` method that adds a valid file image as an attribute to the person.

----
    person.imageProperty().setValue( new FileImage(FilePath));
    updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);
    indicateAddressBookChanged();
----

** The filePath entered must be a valid one, else Weaver will throw an exception. +

----
 if (FileExists) {
    try {
    Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(keywords[0]);
    return new PhotoCommand(index, (keywords[1]));
            }
  catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
                throw new ParseException(
                        String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, PhotoCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
            }

        }
----

** Once the Image is set and the file is then removed from the specified directory, Weaver will no longer display the picture. +

Refer to Figure 3.3 below for the Inheritance diagram of the command. +

image::PhotoCommand.png[width="590" length="150" ]
Figure 3.3

The binder for attaching the image to the Person Card each time, is implemented in the following way. +

----
Image display = new Image(file.toURI().toString());

image.setImage(display);
----

image::Wireframe.png[width="790"]
Figure 3.4 Wireframe

The wireframe for binding the image is shown above in Figure 3.4. +


==== Reasons for this type of implementation

* The feature can be implemented using CommandLine by just stating name of the file. +

* The index can be used easily used to reference the person. +

* The user can access the image from any directory in the PC. +

==== Design considerations

**Aspect:** How should the user choose the Image. +
**Alternative1: (current choice): ** Enter the File path present on
the desktop. +
**Pros:** Makes use of Commad Line Interface. +
**Cons:** User has to make sure the file exists on his/her Desktop. +
**Alternative2:** Make use of FileChooser that prompts user to choose file from
any directory. +
**Pros:** User can choose any image from any location. +
**Cons:** Makes use of a dialog box instead of Command Line. +

---

**Aspect:** How should the image be stored. +
**Alternative1:** Image is stored in the `images` directory of the project by invoking `ImageStorage` class. +
**Pros:** Each image is assigned a unique hashcode. +
**Cons:** The working flow is not easy for incomimg developers to follow. +
**Alternative2:** Image should be stored in the directory whose path is satisfied. +
**Pros:** Easy for new developers to comprehend. +
**Cons:** If the image is removed from the directory, Weaver will have no access to the image. +

// end::addphoto[]

// tag::facebook[]
=== FaceBook Integration

** The facebook command helps the user to view the profile page of a person on the contact list. +
** If the user has no username the facebook page will not be loaded in the browser panel and an exception will be thrown. +
** The command takes in one argument which is the index of the person. +


==== Working flow

** The `FaceBookCommand Parser` class parses the argument and throws an exception if the index entered
is invalid. +
** A new event `handleFaceBookEvent`  is then raised. +
** The Brower Panel class then loads the page with the url of the profile page to be viewed on Facebook. +

Below are few code snippets to guide you through the working of the feature. +

---
 public void loadPersonFaceBookPage(ReadOnlyPerson person, String username) {

 String url =  FACEBOOK_PROFILE_PAGE + username;
loadPage(url);
    }
---

image::FacebookSequence.png[width="790"]

Figure 3.1

** Refer to figure 3.1 above which shows the sequence diagram of the Facebook command. +
It clearly demonstrates how the command interacts with the Logic, Model and UI components. +
It also shows how the event is raised and hence the page is loaded in the browser panel. +



==== Reasons for this kind of implementation

* This helps the user to take a quick glance of the the profile image of the contacts on his/her list. +

* It is better than opening a brower on the desktop. +

* It does not require the user to search for the person on the facebook homepage which can be a tedious task. +


==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How should the user view the profile page. +
**Alternative1 : ** View the profile page on a web browser +
**Pros:** Helps user exercise other functionalities like using messenger. +
**Cons:** Does not make use of Weaver in any useful way. +
**Alternative2:** View the profile page on the browser panel. +
**Pros:** Makes it quicker and adds a function to the personalised Weaver. +
**Cons:** Limits the functionalities that can be used on facebook. +

// end::facebook[]
// tag::email[]
=== Email Feature

** Weaver includes the `email` command which helps users contact persons on their contact list using the default browser in their desktop. +

** This feature will work for users with a Gmail Account. +

[TIP]
The recipients are those persons with a common tag. +

** The command takes in two parameters, the tag name and the subject line that the user wants in the email body. +

Refer to the sequence diagram 4.1 below to see how the command parses the arguements and completes execution. +

image::EmailSequence.png[width="800"]
Figure 4.1 +

The command will throw an exception in the following cases :

 ** The number of tags entered is not equal to 1. +
 ** The tag name does not match any of the tags in Weaver. +
 ** The subject line is not valid. +

**  Below is the high level sequence diagram of the command. +

image::EmailHigh.png[width="800"]

The following code snippet shows the Gmail Browser URL used and how the desktop browser is opened. +

 ---
 appendEmailAddress = appendEmailAddress.substring(0, appendEmailAddress.length() - 1);

 String Gmail_Url = "https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=" + appendEmailAddress + "&su=" + subject;

 if(Desktop.isDesktopSupported()) {
 Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI(Gmail_Url));
         }

 ---

==== Reasons for this kind of implementation

** Gmail is the most widely used web browser and most people are likely to have a Gmail account.
Hence Gmail was the most appropriate email service. +

** Opening the Gmail compose page on the browser is more convenient than working on the browser panel of Weaver since
the browser panel restricts some functionalities. +

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How should the user send the mail. +
**Alternative1 : (currently used) ** Open the default web browser +
**Pros:** Makes sending emails a hassle free job and this also makes use of Weaver CLI in a good way. +
**Cons:** Depends on the type of browser and its compatibility +
**Alternative2:** Send the email using browser panel +
**Pros:** Makes it quicker and adds a function to the personalised Weaver. +
**Cons:** Limits the functionalities that can be used on Gmail since the browser panel is not updated. +

// end::email[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Adding a reminders list to Weaver.

** The reminders panel displays the list of reminders that the user has entered. +
** A reminder class has three main attributes, Details of reminder, due date and the priority level of the reminder. +
** Reminder objects are kept in the UniqueReminderList which ensures there are no duplicate reminders. +
** The Model manager carries out the operations related to reminders. +
** Exceptions are thrown if invalid commands entered. +

** There are three main commands associated with this feature. +

* Adding a reminder to the list. +
e.g. - `reminder g/CS2103T Assignmet p/High d/12.11.2017`. +

* Removing a reminder. +
e.g. - `remove 1`. +

* Changing a reminder. +
e.g. - `change 1 d/12.12.2017`. +

** The commands to add and remove reminders will inherit from Undoable Command. +

The diagram (Figure 5.1) below gives the high level architecture diagram of the implementation. +

image::ReminderArchi.png[width="800"]

** The reminders panel is implemented in a similar manner like the person list panel. +
** Data is written/stored in the same addressbook.xml file. +

image::LogicReminder.png[width="800"]
(Figure 5.2)

Figure 5.2 above shows the Logic Component Diagram of the Reminders Panel implementation. +
[TIP]
 Note how the LogicManager class implements the interface Logic and is associated with the undo redo stack. +

==== Reasons for this kind of implementation

** The implementation is easy to follow and comprehend. +
** Storing in the same file makes the organization better. +

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How to store each reminder +
**Alternative1 : (currently used) ** Reminders stored in the addressbook.xml file +
**Pros:** Implementation easy to follow for future developers. +
**Cons:** Can violate higher levels of software engineering principles. +
**Alternative2:** Store reminder objects separately in a different xml file +
**Pros:** More in sync with SE principles. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement and follow. +

// end::reminder[]

// tag::nusmods[]
=== Nusmods Integration

** The nusmods command helps the user to view the nusmods website which displays module information stored in the
person's remark.
** If the module information are not stored in the correct format or there is no such module in nusmods, it will not be
displayed.


==== Working flow
When the person panel is clicked, an FXML function will handle this and start to parse the module information.
After parsing this information into URL format which is supported by NUSMODS, an URL is made and passed to the
Google engine. And the brower panel will go to the NUSMODS page which contains this person's module information.
 +

image::nusmods.png[width="800"]

==== Reasons for this kind of implementation

* This helps the user to take a quick glance of the the Nusmods information.
* It is better than opening a brower on the desktop. +
* It is convenient for users to shedule their time using this feature. +
// end::nusmods[]

// tag::encrypt[]
=== Encrypt your file (not used in V1.5).

** With this feature embedded in the Weaver, all the files will be encrypted automatically +

* When user tries to login, the "account.json" file is decrypted and information is fetched for checking the
authentication of the accounts. Once the check is finished, it's encrypted. +

* When the user login, his xml file will be decrypted and become editable.  +

* When the user logout, his xml file will be encrypted and become not readable. +

==== Mechanism of encrytion
** We use RES mechanism provided by java to make encrypted files.  +
** When a file needs to be encrypted/decrypted, the system first create a temporary file named "temp.xml"
to store the encryption/decryption information.
** After this temporary file successfully stores all the information. The system will try to rename it as the
original name of the file before encryption/decryption. And then the previous original file will be replaced by the
encrypted/decrypted. (This works on OSX but not on Windows and UNIX).

==== Reason for giving up this feature

** The most important reason is, different operating system has different ways to manage the files. Thus the current
mechanism might not work as expected on different operating systems. When replacing files with their encrypted/decrypted copy,
different operating system will behave differently. Some will replace the file while some will keep both. +
// end::encrypt[]

// tag::Logging[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5.6.1 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing

**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Suggested programming tasks to get started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in this section link:#improving-each-component[Improving a Component].

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. The section link:#creating-a-new-command-code-remark-code[Creating a new command: `remark`] explains how to go about adding such a feature.

=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#logic-component[Design: Logic Component] section before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/590/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#model-component[Design: Model Component] section before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] API needs to be updated.
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Add the implementation of `deleteTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/591/files[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#ui-component[Design: UI Component] section before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in grey, and `colleagues` tags can be all in red.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#initTags(ReadOnlyPerson)`] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(event)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/593/files[PR] for the full solution.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.

==== `Storage` component

[TIP]
Do take a look at the link:#storage-component[Design: Storage Component] section before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594/files[PR] for the full solution.

=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `ReadOnlyPerson` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Main:**

. Add three methods `setRemark(Remark)`, `getRemark()` and `remarkProperty()`. Be sure to implement these newly created methods in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`], which implements the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`] interface.
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
. Be sure to modify the logic of the constructor and `toModelType()`, which handles the conversion to/from  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`ReadOnlyPerson`].

**Tests:**

. Fix `validAddressBook.xml` such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard#bindListeners()`] to add the binding for `remark`.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the remark label.
. In link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCardTest.java[`PersonCardTest`], call `personWithTags.setRemark(ALICE.getRemark())` to test that changes in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/ReadOnlyPerson.java[`Person`] 's remark correctly updates the corresponding link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`].

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
