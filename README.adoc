* Weaver is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). +
* It is a Java sample application intended to help students studying in National University of Sinagpore. +
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules. +
